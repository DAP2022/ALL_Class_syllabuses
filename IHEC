# Inclusive Healthcare Education Career mentoring

What are the competencies identified as crucial to the practice of medicine? The AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges) lists a number of pre-professional competencies that are central to the practice of medicine: https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/what-medical-schools-are-looking-understanding-15-core-competencies

Notably, these skills are not the focus of traditional undergraduate coursework, but are covered by our proposed curriculum.

### Goals

•	Introduce key concepts of humanistic healthcare, including medical ethics and social determinants of health, in the early professional identity formation of pre-health students. 
•	Provide a structured clinical experience that will integrate with required course content and overcome opportunity barriers that may prevent students from accessing these experiences meaningfully, especially first generation and URiM undergraduate students.
•	Connect different departments across campus, reduce the frustrations of distinct entries into - and expectations of - campus 'silos', and to best support students as they seek foundational experiences in healthcare across the entire university.
•	Translate the "hidden curriculum" of pre-professional expectations and reduce financial barriers for applying to medical school with an in-house MCAT course. 
•	To offer an official UR pre-health community of learning and cultivate a sense of belonging for URiM undergraduates as they explore their interest in careers in healthcare.

### Future goals: 
o	Establishing outreach to local high schools/counselors and establishment of pipeline directly between pathway and URMS
o	Additional integrations between departments and schools across iterations
o	Including summer research experiences for participants. This would allow us to ask to ask for funding from NSF/NIH to expand the pathway.   

### Proposed core components 
1.	E-portfolio: Participants would sign up for an e-portfolio on a dedicated Blackboard page. This would include an annual updated CV, self reflection questions for each year, reflections on experiences of shadowing, volunteering, statement of purpose. This will result in a centralized location for information that will be crucial for eventual applications to healthcare graduate programs.
2.	Clinical community engagement clearinghouse: We will be partnering with hospice, student groups, friends of strong, other existing URMC and community clinical opportunities (ie. ASL Primary Care clinics) TBD. 
3.	BIOL/MHB XXX:  2 X 2 credit course with experiential/shadowing component (2 credits in Fall, 2 credits in Spring, do not have to be taken in the same academic year). Include attendance and participation in a meeting every two weeks as well as attendance at Medical Center case-based presentations:  
o	1 Schwartz Interdisciplinary Ethics Rounds per semester
o	2 Grand Rounds (Medicine, Surgery, or Pediatrics) per semester
o	Structured shadowing experiences (hospice care, family medicine, currently considering others): 
    * Introduction to Hospice and Palliative Care: student will have [5-10] contact hours/semester in a structured outpatient volunteer experience with CompassionNet, where they will shadow a palliative care physician, hospice nurse, and chaplain during the delivery of in-home hospice care. 
    * Introduction to Primary Care: student will have [5-10] contact hours/semester in a structured outpatient volunteer experience in a primary care setting (Highland Family Medicine, Culver Medical Group, others).
    * TBD: We will pair with other community health opportunities that are appropriate to the aims of this program. 
 
o	6 iZone speakers – every two weeks, all participants would come together to listen to an invited speaker (ie. could be physicians, nurse/nurse practitioners, speakers on other topics/opportunities).
o	Current medical student mentors
o	Capstone paper after the second semester of participation.
4.	CAS XXX – MCAT preparation course (via Gwen Greene Career Center and various departments with subject matter specialists)
5.	Professionalism/Team work/inter professional Communication course: TBD  
6.	1 course Philosophical-Ethical Determinants of Healthcare domain
a.	ex. MHB 210 – Bioethics at the Bedside
7.	1 course in the Sociocultural Determinants of Healthcare domain
a.	ex. EDE 437 – Diversity and Equity in Health Professions Education
b.	ex. ANTH 102 – Introduction to Medical Anthropology

### Learning objectives

•	To learn the ethical principles impacting healthcare decisions, and apply those principles to simulated and actual clinical cases.
•	To understand the social and cultural determinants of health by engaging with humanities, social science, and public health coursework that requires critical thinking and synthesis skills in these areas.
•	To introduce the healthcare professional-patient relationship through structured, mentored clinical experiences at URMC.
•	To integrate didactic coursework and clinical experience into a written capstone project that explores a relevant topic of interest in humanistic healthcare.
•	To offer high-quality community-engagement opportunities.
•	To help students explore their own early professional identity development through reflective writing and facilitated discussion about clinical experiences.
•	To train undergraduates on how to operate in teams: how to work together to solve large problems, and how to develop respectful, effective communication in complex circumstances.
•	To prompt students to begin writing their distance travelled narrative into a cohesive e-portfolio.
