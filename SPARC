The Supporting Professional and Research Competencies (SPARC) pathway

The central purpose of the SPARC curricular pathway is to equip undergraduate students with portable science
technical/analytical, professional, and communication skills that support their successful participation in
2+ semesters of research immersion. The SPARC pathway will ensure that participants acquire sufficient
competencies in three domains that are central to effective science: technical/analytical, professional, and
communication skills. SPARC courses will be in the form of low-risk, high-reward, one-credit courses, and
will wrap around 2+ semesters of mentored, research immersion. The program utilizes a framework of
incremental successes built on explicit milestones and feedback and includes opportunities for career
exploration and professional identity development. The SPARC program is specifically designed to
address barriers faced by students from underrepresented groups (e.g. first generation college students,
underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and women).
