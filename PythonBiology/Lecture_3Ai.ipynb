    "            .keys() -  returns an array of the dictionary’s keys\n",
    "\n",

    "            \n",
    "            .get() – takes two arguments but the second argument is optional and it useful if the dictionary does not contain the key that is being searched for. It may not be immediately obvious to you why the .get method is so useful. However, if you accidentally call a key that doesn’t exist, the program will stop and raise an exception which could de-rail your project. By using .get() you can specify the second argument for what to return if the key doesn’t exist so that your program doesn’t just stop\n",
    "            \n",
    "             .sorted() - We can sort key list before looping to impose a specific order on it that can be repeatable\n",
    "             .items() - Instead of returning a single value or a list of values, items method returns a list of paired values so we can iterate over pairs of data (this is a bit weird…) but we have seen something similar with enumerate function in lists. The more technical definition is that the .items method returns an array of tuples which consists of a key/value pair from the dictionary\n",

    "                             example: \n",

    "\n",
    "    But! With .get(), you can specify what to return if key doesn’t exist! For instance, in the nucleotide example, we happened to know that, with how the loop was structured, the trinucleotide would have to be present 0 times if it wasn't in our final dictionary so we could specify the count of \"0\" if the trinucleotide wasn't present.  \n",

Unordered means that you can’t search by indexing like you can a list <--- note that this is no longer true. The latest version of Python treats dictionaries in the same way as lists. It is still useful to appreciate this limitations when you are dealing with older code, though!"
