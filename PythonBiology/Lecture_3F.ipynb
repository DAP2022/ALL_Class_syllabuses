    "# Object oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "* Python can be “object oriented” \n",
    "    * It manipulates objects – a structure that contains data and functions (called methods when they are part of an object) bundled together\n",
    "* Object oriented programming is the practice of creating new types of things \n",
    "    * OOP adds a level of flexibility and readability to your code\n",
    "* Steve Jobs explains OOP (Rolling Stone, 1994):\n",
    "\n",
    ">'Objects are like people. They’re living, breathing things that have knowledge inside them about how to do things and have memory inside them so they can remember things. And rather than interacting with them at a very low level, you interact with them at a very high level of abstraction, like we’re doing right here.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Here’s an example: If I’m your laundry object, you can give me your dirty clothes and send me a message that says, “Can you get my clothes laundered, please.” I happen to know where the best laundry place in San Francisco is. And I speak English, and I have dollars in my pockets. So I go out and hail a taxicab and tell the driver to take me to this place in San Francisco. I go get your clothes laundered, I jump back in the cab, I get back here. I give you your clean clothes and say, “Here are your clean clothes.”\n",
    "\n",
    ">You have no idea how I did that. You have no knowledge of the laundry place. Maybe you speak French, and you can’t even hail a taxi. You can’t pay for one, you don’t have dollars in your pocket. Yet, I knew how to do all of that. And you didn’t have to know any of it. All that complexity was hidden inside of me, and we were able to interact at a very high level of abstraction. That’s what objects are. They encapsulate complexity, and the interfaces to that complexity are high level.'\n",

    "* Object oriented programming creates classes that solve groups of related programming problems rather than a single well-defined problem\n",

    "OOP is a way to **force logical organization onto your code with conventional syntax** that will make it cleaner, easier to understand (for you and other users of your code) and much easier for future you (or someone else) to maintain. OOP is particularly valuable and important when you work on projects with multiple pieces. At this point in your coding journey, re-writing your small chunks of code to be OOP might feel like (to steal a metaphor from a colleague) \"cracking a walnut with a sledgehammer\". Of course, you might want to be skeptical of the benefits of OOP because I have basically used the same argument for functional programming (ie. when there are lots of moving parts, and you are working on a large project, functional programming might be the most efficient solution). I am pointing this out to emphasize that these are simply tools for you use - in some cases, OOP will be superior and, in others, Functional Programming will be the best to use. For small scripts (like the ones you have been creating in this course so far), imperative programming is sufficient. You should be competent in each of these three general programming domains so that you can pick the right tool for any possible problem. \n",

    "## Objects\n",
    "* We have already seen a number of different types of simple objects: \n",
    "    * examples:\n",
    "               1. len(“Python”)  - python is checking to see if the string object that you passed to the function len() has a length\n",
    "               2. file object - input=open(\"text_file.txt\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* an object is an **instance of a particular class**\n",
    "    * A class organizes and creates objects with similar **attributes** and **methods**\n",
    "        * attributes are sort of the 'nouns' of the class\n",
    "        * methods are equivalent to the 'verbs' of the class\n",
    "    * A class is a **blueprint** for building objects (you can define a class but not create any instances of it in your code). The blueprint just sits in a file drawer somewhere until\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes\n",
    "* Once we have created a new class, it behaves the same way as built-in classes in python – we can pass it as an argument to a function or method, we can store the object in a variable, list or dictionary etc\n",
    "* remember that a class is the just the template or blueprint, it doesn't do anything until it is called and an object of that class (an **instance** of that class) is called!\n",
    "* simple classes consist of: \n",
    "    * Class keyword\n",
    "    * Name of class\n",
    "    * Inheritance of attributes and methods from other classes\n",
    "        *Example:  class Newclass(object):\n",
    "          * Inheritance from previously created class “object” endows the Newclass with the properties of “object” - NOTE: ACTUALLY THIS IS NO LONGER NECESSARY WITH PYTHON 3!! but you might still see it. I actually think it is a helpful convention.  \n",
    "          * Convention dictates that class names start with a capital letter        \n",
    "     * OOP classes have child classes that can inherit the attributes and methods from their parent class. We can choose WHICH particular attributes and methods that each child inherits (it doesn't have to inherit all of them, it can inherit a subset of them). We can also have new methods/attributes that only the child possesses and not the parent. \n",
    "     \n",
    "To make it a tiny bit more complex - if we know that we want a bunch of child classes to inherit attributes/methods from a parent class, we can even set up a kind of 'dummy placeholder' parent class -- called an abstract class -- that will never actually be instantiated itself, but will, rather just serve as a way to allow a bunch of child classes to inherit similar attributes/methods without having to define them in each individual child class.
