    "This is a **simple** simulator of mutation which will clarify the type of large state space that MCMC addresses efficiently. There is a bit more to MCMC than is given in this program but it is a start... We will start with a simple four nucleotide sequence \"CTAG\" (note that you can, of course, start with any four letter nucleotide) and mutate it a specified number of times. We will use an extremely simplified mutation matrix (picture illustrating the model is given below) with a probability model defined as: the transition -0.1, tranversion - each transversion is 0.05- and no mutation -0.8- probabilities are the same for all nucleotides among other simplifying assumptions. To refresh your molecular evolution knowledge: Transversion is when a purine mutates to a pyramidine or vice versa, i.e. A--> C, A-->T or C-->G, transition is when a purine mutates to a different purine (A--> G or G-->A) or a pyramadine mutates to a different pyramidine (T-->C or C---> T). \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a question on one of your problem sets where I ask you to re-write this mess of a simulator in a much more elegant/efficient manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the breakdown of strategy: \n",
    "1. Start sequence is specified. In this case, we are running the string \"CTAG\" but I should be able to substitute any sequence of *any length*. \n",
    "2. Function that takes the starting sequence and number of times to repeat as an argument and using conditions, mutates the start string n times appropriately. Note that in this model, a mutation event can be a transition, transversion or no mutation at all. In fact, out of 1000000 simulations, you can expect mutations will occur about 200000 times (20%). \n",
    "3. We will want to sample the mutated sequence at different points in our simulator. This will partially be to trouble shoot and de-bug but also because we often want to do this in MCMC to sort of test whether the equilibrium state has been reached (that doesn't really work under this particular model since the nucleotides are considered completely independent but most models are more complex so it is a good habit to incorporate into this kind of code.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the function that lays out one round of where the mutations happen. We can call the function with a specified *nsteps*."
