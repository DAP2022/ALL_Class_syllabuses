At the very beginning of your Python journey, I don't want you to get overwhelmed by small details BUT it is always good practice to start your programming by following conventions. Therefore, here are the conventions: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ Don't worry about all of them (yet, by the end of the course, you should be adopting the relevant conventions), just know you should be using 4 spaces (not tabs) for indentation.
