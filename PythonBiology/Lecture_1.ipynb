    "(a) \"We suck, until we don't\": on learning new skills (and a bit about academia: http://www.academichermit.com/2016/06/27/novy-installation.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In spite of all these failures we press on going deeper and deeper. I recently tried to count the number of things that I learned as a PhD student 15 years ago that I still use today. The list consists of ... writing, giving talks, and perhaps most importantly, thinking. Of course, as time progresses so does the technology, the tools, and the medium that we apply them to. I love programming. I feel like Bob Ross when I use R to generate a figure - thinking of where to put a happy little legend or how to remove the always very sad looking pie chart. It’s fun and it’s something that I can do between filling out ICUCA protocols and trying to figure out how to tell the IBC how we know that bacteria are dead after being both bleached and autoclaved. Unlike a piece of wood, a script is perpetually malleable and I can come back years later and make it better. It reflects my progress as a scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am regularly asked what I suggest doing to learn how to write computer programs. It is a great honor for someone else to recognize a set of skills that I work hard to hone, but I honestly want to answer “the hell if I know.” The honest truth is that I took a semester long class in a horrible programming language - Pascal - and promptly forgot most of it. Then I picked up other languages by looking at the horrendous code from others and modifying it to see what the code did. I would work chapter by chapter through a programming book and then write my own horrendous code. Over time, I like to think that it has gotten better. I hadn’t found a succinct way to describe this until I got a call from a colleague at another institution who was really interested in strengthening his group’s programming skills and perhaps converting some of their home grown code into a package for others to use. For the first time I answered honestly, “You’re going to suck, but it will get better.” .\n",
    "\n",
    "We live in a world where “sucking” isn’t something we can own and be proud of. We either expect that we can be experts in 24 hours or we can never be experts because intelligence or expertise is a gift. Both of these ideas are insulting to people that have busted their asses to get better. I know that whenever I’ve wanted to pick up a skill, it’s taken a lot of mistakes and repetition to get better at that skill. Similarly, when there’s a new thing I have learned, but can’t find the time to practice, I know I’m losing my skills. As some of you know too well, the 5 handicap I carried in high school would be a bit higher today because I only play golf once every couple of years. Learning new skills and technologies isn’t just about reading every book on the subject or running a new analysis for a study. We need to practice those skills under the guide of a mentor or a community to get better. We need the support of a community that will help us go beyond the expertise of the community. We are then able to give back to that community to raise the community with ourselves. We need time and mentors to help us along. We need to seek review of our work to get an external assessment of how we’re doing. Because we suck, until we don’t.\"\n",
