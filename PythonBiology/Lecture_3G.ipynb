    "•  There is a subtle difference between ADTs and DS (I won't do it true justice, but here is a summary):\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Abstract data types (ADTs)** is a mutable data type that describes a collection of information in terms of the logical operations that manipulate individual elements in it. Basically: they are classes that contain attributes and methods that are hidden from the user so the user doesn't have to worry about the exact means of implementation (which also means that - behind the scenes- how a specific ADT is implemented might change with no impact on how it is called or used by the client). Find more general information here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type. ADTs are theoretical and, so, are not a function of any one given programming language, but are present in all programming languages. Some examples (pulled from the same wikipedia article) of common ADTs: \n",
    "**List**, Set, **Map**, Graph, Tree, **Stack , Queue, Dequeue**\n",
    "\n",
    "• In constrast, a __data structure__ is the concrete manifestation of the ADT and is a way of organizing the information inside a computer (ie. how the data is stored) that maintains the relationship between the items. An algorithm is a series of steps that the computer performs on the data structure (or, set of data structures) to accomplish a desired operation.(find more information here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "• As usual, a useful overview can be found at geeksforgeeks. Take note that this describes Lists, Stacks and Queues for Java, but the same principles hold for Python (since abstract data types are abstractions/models): https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-data-types/\n",
    "\n",
    "• ADT are impacted by the efficiency of code. I don't want to get into a tangent about Big O notation, since we haven't cared too much about it so far in this course, but it becomes important when you are seriously examing ADTs. For our shallow overview, we can simply consider that Big O notation (order of function) tells us how long a function will take to be executed depending on the method being used and the input data. \n",
    "      * if you want to learn more about Big O notation, you can read: \n",
    "        1. https://web.mit.edu/16.070/www/lecture/big_o.pdf\n",
    "        2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation\n",
    "\n",
    "• Implementation of abstract data type (ADT) is a class. Hey, we just learned about classes in OOP!\n"

When you remove the books, the most recently added one is on the top so it comes off first. You can also think of trays that are stacked in the cafeteria. The back button on your browser uses a stack to order your webpages.) – \"Last In, First Out\" (LIFO)\n",
    "      * Good summary of stack methods here (I have used their example in the cell below): https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/BasicDS/TheStackAbstractDataType.html\n",
    "      * Like all objects, there are methods: \n",
    "          * stack() - creates new empty stack\n",
    "          * pop() - removes the top item from the stack and modifies the stack to only include the remaining non-popped off items\n",
    "          * peek() - let's you look at the top item in the stack without removing it or modifying the stack\n",
    "          * push(item_name) - adds a new item to the top of the stack\n",

    "\"DNA-based memory systems are being reported with increasing frequency. However, dynamic DNA data structures able to store and recall information in an ordered way, and able to be interfaced with external nucleic acid computing circuits, have so far received little attention. **Here we present an in vitro implementation of a stack data structure using DNA polymers. The stack is able to record combinations of two different DNA signals, release the signals into solution in reverse order, and then re-record. We explore the accuracy limits of the stack data structure through a stochastic rule-based model of the underlying polymerisation chemistry.** We derive how the performance of the stack increases with the efficiency of washing steps between successive reaction stages, and report how stack performance depends on the history of stack operations under inefficient washing. Finally, we discuss refinements to improve molecular synchronisation and future open problems in implementing an autonomous chemical data structure.\"\n",
