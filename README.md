# A Modern Curriculum for Biologists

1. Biostatistics
2. Data Analysis (R), I have also included the R book that I wrote (with data sets from Whitlock and Schluter) to accompany the Data Analysis in R course.
3. Introduction to progamming for biologists' (Python)
4. "Exploring Bias in Algorithms: the New 'Jim Code'"

I will add Jupyter notebooks and rmd files that accompany each lecture of each course as time allows.
