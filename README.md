# ALL_Class_syllabuses
Biostatistics, Data Analysis (R), Introduction to progamming for biologists' (Python), "Exploring Bias in Algorithms: the New 'Jim Code'", 
and "Focusing on Bayes' Theorem" are all available.

I have also included the R book that I wrote (with data sets from Whitlock and Schluter) to accompany the Data Analysis in R course.

I will add Jupyter notebooks and rmd files that accompany each lecture of each course as time allows.
