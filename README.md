# A Modern Curriculum for Biologists

Here are the syllabuses for the following courses that I have created and taught at the University of Rochester.
1. **Biostatistics**
    a. Syllabus
    b. Pdf files for the lectures. 
    c. I haven't included problem sets, recitations, or links to the videos yet. 
2. **Data Analysis in R**
    a. Syllabus
    b. Notebooks corresponding to the 12 modules in rmd file formats
    c. I have also included the R book that I wrote (with data sets from Whitlock and Schluter) to accompany the Data Analysis in R course
    d. I have not included links to the videos of this course yet. 
3. **Introduction to programming for biologists' (Python)**
    a. Syllabus
    b. Jupyter notebooks for the course material
    c. I have not yet included links to the videos of this course. 
4. **"Basic Bioinformatics for yeast"**: these are pdfs that I created as a guest lecturer for a semester long experimental course. 
5. **"Exploring Bias in Algorithms: the New 'Jim Code'"** This course fulfilled an upper level writing course. 
6. **"Focusing on Bayes' Theorem"** This course also fulfilled an upper level writing course. 
8. **"A Synthesis of Computational Biology for Seniors"**: A course intended to synthesize technical skills learned during an undergraduate as a computational biology major and add some sprinkling of professional skills coaching.

I have also added the general outlines of two curriculum pathways, S.P.A.R.C. and I.H.E.C., that integrate experiential learning with skills necessary in research labs and for medical training.

## 1. SPARC (Supporting Professional and Research Competencies):

## 2. IHEC (Inclusive Healthcare Education and Mentoring):

Finally, this is a summary image from a larger presentation on planning out and optimizing your undergraduate experience. This was specifically targeting pre-health students, but it is generalizable to students with wider interests.
