# A Modern Curriculum for Biologists

## Section 1: Syllabuses and Material
Here are the syllabuses for the following courses that I have created and taught at the University of Rochester. 
1. **Biostatistics**
    a. Syllabus
    b. Pdf files for the lectures. 
    c. I haven't included problem sets, recitations, or links to the videos yet. 
2. **Data Analysis in R**
    a. Syllabus
    b. Notebooks corresponding to the 12 modules in rmd file formats
    c. I have also included the R book that I wrote (with data sets from Whitlock and Schluter) to accompany the Data Analysis in R course
    d. I have not included links to the videos of this course yet. 
3. **Introduction to programming for biologists' (Python)**
    a. Syllabus
    b. Jupyter notebooks for the course material
    c. I have not yet included links to the videos of this course. 
4. **"Basic Bioinformatics for yeast"**: these are pdfs that I created as a guest lecturer for a semester long experimental course. 
5. **"Exploring Bias in Algorithms: the New 'Jim Code'"** This course fulfilled an upper level writing course. 
6. **"Focusing on Bayes' Theorem"** This course also fulfilled an upper level writing course. 
8. **"A Synthesis of Computational Biology for Seniors"**: A course intended to synthesize technical skills learned during an undergraduate as a computational biology major and add some sprinkling of professional skills coaching. 
9. **"Precision Medicine: Customizing Care through Genetics"**  https://rochesteronline.precollegeprograms.org/medicine This was a collaboration between the University of Rochester and Kaplan and the material was co-developed between me and Alexis Stein, Ph.D. I have not included a syllabus, but I have pasted the link in case you are interested.

## Section 2: Curricular Pathways 
#### I have also added the general outlines of two curriculum pathways, S.P.A.R.C. and I.H.E.C., that integrate experiential learning with skills necessary in research labs and for medical training. 
--------------------------------------------------------

## 1. SPARC (Supporting Professional and Research Competencies):

## 2. IHEC (Inclusive Healthcare Education and Mentoring):

## Section 3: Advising
#### Finally, this is a summary image from a larger presentation on planning out and optimizing your undergraduate experience. I have held multiple advising positions (Biology BA, REMS co-Director, Health Committee etc) and this is just one particular presentaion,specifically targeting pre-health students. It is generalizable to students with wider interests and captures the philosophy of how to map out your goals effectively to design (as much as possible) what you want to get out of your degree.
