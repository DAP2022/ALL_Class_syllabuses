# A Modern Curriculum for Biologists

1. Biostatistics
2. Data Analysis (R), I have also included the R book that I wrote (with data sets from Whitlock and Schluter) to accompany the Data Analysis in R course.
3. Introduction to progamming for biologists' (Python)
4. "Exploring Bias in Algorithms: the New 'Jim Code'" 
5. "Focusing on Bayes' Theorem" are all available.

I will add Jupyter notebooks and rmd files that accompany each lecture of each course as time allows.

I will also add two curriculum pathways, SPARC and IHEC, that integrate experiential learning with skills necessary in research labs and for medical training.
