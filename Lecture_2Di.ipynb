    "\n",
    "* Scope  - is the region of the program from which a variable can be referenced. It is the hierarchical order in which namespace is searched to find the object. ** L.E.G.B ** is the acronym for how scope officially works: Local, Enclosed, Global and Built-in. Local can only be 'reached' by their local environment (Function), Enclosed is accessed from inside nested function, Global is accessed anywhere in the program and Built-in are reserved names in Python (like keywords such as 'def'). \n",

    "\n",
    "* Local variables (within the function) cease to exist once the function is completed - the local variables are released from memory once the function is finished (so the memory is erased)... \n",
    "\n",
    "* Potential Confusion Warning: We saw the idea of scope when we discussed loops. Keep in mind that variables that are passed into a function don’t change their value outside of the function (ie. in the main body of the program)…usually. This is because most variables that we are interested in using are immutable such as numbers and tuples (python passes them ‘by value’). However, we were also talking about *iterating over lists* and confusingly, lists work a little bit differently than regular variables because they are made up of pointers rather than actual data/variables. Thus, they can be manipulated/changed from within a loop (called 'changed in place') and maintain that difference even once the loop is finished. Mutable data types such as lists CAN HAVE THEIR VALUE CHANGED by a function and passed back to the call where **it will remain changed.** However, this is not true of most variables since most variable are immutable.
